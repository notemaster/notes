Time to make some notes ;
* Big O notation
Big O: An upper bound on time. ~ <= relqationship.
\Omega: Lower bound on time
\Theta: O and \Omega. something is \Theta(N) if it is both 
O(N) and \Omega (N)
** Sorts
*** Quick Sort:
Desc: Pick a random element as "pivot" and swap values in array st
the elements less than pivot appear before elements greater than pivot:
In effect a partial sort:

| Best                | Worst         | Expected   |
|---------------------+---------------+------------|
| O(N)                | O(N^2)        | O(N log N) |
| Case                | Case          | Case       |
| Elements are equal; | reverse order |            |

For many algorithms, Worst and expected are the same.
